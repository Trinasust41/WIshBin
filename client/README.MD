## The setup phase and requirements for client side or frontend

## Installation:
  * First the project need to be downloaded or else we need to create a react app manually by giving the command npx create-react-app app_name
  * Then we need to go to the api folder by typing cd client
  * If we want to manually create node modules manually, we need to run the command npm install for creating the node modules
  * Then we need to run the command npm start
  
  
## Requirements 
We need Reactjs, Redux for the developments
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

We can also use yarn in stead of npm. For that we need the supported libraries. For the icons, navigation, or for the other requirements we may need to install the supported library for the project like material icons or react-router-dom or cors

If we want to have the connection with the backend then we must start the backend server for building the connection with database. Then we need to start the client server. These two servers will run simultaneously.
