## This is setup phage for e-commerce api.

## Installing the project:
  * First we need to download the project and delete the node modules and run the command npm init
  * Then we will run the npm i command
  * After that we will run the command npm i express nodemon dotenv mongoose for the setup
  * We may need cors library for that we need to run npm i cors for setup
  * we need to connect the database to the server. For this we need to create a .env file and give the mongo_url which is generated for the user in a mongodb cloud.
  * We also do have to provide port no. For the ecommerce api server the port no is 5000
  * we need to give the database name and our credentials to the url so that it can automatically create the database.
  * Then we wil run npm start or npm run dev as per package.json
  * we have to install the related dependency as per requirement in the code
  
The server will start at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) 
For the project, in building api we need to use nodejs, mongodb, expressjs. This is a restapi by which the connections will be buit up.
